Build and installation of psi46expert
=====================================

1. Dependencies
---------------
To install psi46expert a few libraries and programs are required:

  - libusb-1.0 and libusb-0.1
    normally available as a package for your Linux distribution
  - libftd2xx-1.0.x or libftd2xx-0.4.x
    download from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
  - ROOT
    download from http://root.cern.ch or try your Linux distriution's
    package repository
  - libtool, autoconf, automake
    always available as a package for your Linux distribution,
    normally installed by default

If these are installed in special directories (not /usr or /usr/local)
then you have to take measures that the compiler finds your files
(set and export PATH, CPATH, LIBRARY_PATH environment variables).

2. Preparing the sources after SVN (subversion) checkout
--------------------------------------------------------
After checking out the sources from SVN, run the following command
in the working directory:

	./autogen.sh

3. Compiling the sources
------------------------
Run

	./configure [--prefix=SOMEDIR]
	make

with the option [--prefix=SOMEDIR] optional. The prefix determines
where the installed files would go. By default this is /usr/local
(binaries would go to /usr/local/bin, libraries to /usr/local/lib
and so on).

5. Installing the software
--------------------------
The software is installed by typing

	make install

4. Running the software
-----------------------
You will need a configuration directory for Modules/ROCs:

	cp -r data/defaultParameters<X> WHEREVER

Then you can run

	psi46expert -dir WHEREVER

5. Frequent problems
--------------------
  1.	If ./autogen.sh does not work, you probably don't have
  	libtool installed. Or autoconf, automake. These are
  	standard packages in a Linux system. Check your Linux
  	manual on how to install packages.

  2.	If ./configure doesn't find some header or library,
	install what is requested and make sure it can be found
	by the compiler. The libraries libusb-1.0.so or libusb-0.1.so
	may require a symbolic link to libusb.so. This may also be
	true for libftd2xx. Make sure you follow the instructions of
	the libftd2xx library! libusb comes as a package in all Linux
	distributions. There are two versions: 0.1 and 1.0. Install
	both to be safe. (Your favourite distribution should provide
	the packages.)
	For libraries in special directories you can use
	
		export PATH=$PATH:whatever
		export CPATH=$CPATH:whatever
		export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:whatever
	
	before calling ./configure . This is best put in your .bashrc
	file in your home directory.

  3.	If 'make' fails, you should talk to a code maintainer. There
  	is one case which is known to fail: If you try to compile
  	the software against the older version libftd2xx-0.4.x
  	on a 32 bit machine, then there may be a compilation error
  	in USBInterface.cc, depending on which compiler version you
  	are using. It might say something about being unable to
  	convert a 'unsigned long *' into a 'unsigned int *'. On a
  	32 bit Linux system, they are actually exactly the same, so
  	you can pass the variable
  	
  		./configure CFLAGS=-fpermissive
  	
  	to the configuration script, which should make the compiler
  	ignore the problem.

  4.	If psi46expert won't start because a library is missing,
  	set your custom library path with
  	
  		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:YOURPATH
  
  5.	If psi46expert cannot open a port to the testboard, then
  	make sure the testboard name is correct in the configParameters.dat
  	file in you config directory. If this is the case, make
  	sure that you have write access to your USB devices:
  	
  		ls -l /dev/bus/usb/00?/*
  	
  	You can change these permissions permanently if you create a file
  	/etc/udev/rules.d/10-testboard.rules which contains
  	
  		SUBSYSTEM == "usb", ATTR{product} == "DLP-USB245M", GROUP="usb", MODE="0664"
  	
  	and create a group "usb" and add yourself to that group. Newly
  	plugged devices will have the correct permissions. For the
  	libftd2xx-0.4.x library version it may be that you need the
  	usbfs. You can get this by putting the following line into your
  	/etc/fstab file:
  	
  		none /proc/bus/usb usbfs devgid=1000,devmode=0660 0 0
  	
  	where you should replace the number 1000 with the group id of
  	your group 'usb'. You can then either reboot the machine or
  	do a
  	
  		mount -a
  	
  	as root.

  6.	If you wish to use other devices with FTDI chips that require
  	the bit bang mode and/or the kernel modules usbserial and
  	ftdi_sio, then you should install libftd2xx-0.4.x.

  7.	If all things fail, you should talk to a code maintainer. Post
  	a message to the hypernews list 'Pixel psi46 Testboard':
  	
  		hn-cms-pixel-psi46-testboard@cern.ch
  	
  	This requires a CERN account.
